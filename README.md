# bluerain
bluerain is a custom build Drupal template. It is independent of any framework and will not import any third party libraries except for the jquery library shipped with core.

As of now this template is still work in progress and also the directory structure is not yet ideal. However, the template is in general usable although rather rudimentary.

Changes to the template my occur unrelated and even brake compatibility with features that used to work.
