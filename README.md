# bluerain
bluerain is a custom build Drupal template. It uses some features of the bootstrap framework and also provides FontAwesome icons for use in the pages.
As of now this template is still work in progress and also the directory is structure is not yet ideal. However, the template is in general usable although rather rudementary.
